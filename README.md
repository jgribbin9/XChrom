# Female Bias of Autoimmunity- X Chromosome Escape Project

This is the repository for code written by John Gribbin (MD '25, Frank H. Netter MD School of Medicine) for his medical school capstone project focusing on genetic investigation of the female bias of autoimmunity. The project aims to characterize abberant gene expression related to the X chromosome associated with the autoimmune diseases Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using public RNAseq data avaliable on Gene Expresson Omnibus.

The code provided is unedited and intended to illustrate the learning process while undergoing this project. Files include DESeq2 analysis, which includes the script for isolation of the X chromsome from count data, and EdgeR analysis, which includes GoVenn and other functions for comparing sets of gene expression across different parameters.
