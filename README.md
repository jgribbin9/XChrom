X Chromosome Project Medical School Capstone
This is the repository for code written by John Gribbin (MD '25) for his medical school capstone project focusing on genetic investigation of the female bias of autoimmunity. The project aims to characterize abberant gene expression related to the X chromosome associated with the autoimmune diseases Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) using public RNAseq data avaliable on Gene Expresson Omnibus.
